ARPANET 1969

- packet-switching, which breaks data into small "packets" so they can be transmitted efficiently across the network. 
- One of the first ARPANET applications was Telnet, which allowed a researcher at one ARPANET site to log into a computer at another site.

1970: ARPANET expands
- Each ARPANET site had a router known as an Interface Message Processor.

1973: ARPANET goes international
- New applications: Email was invented in 1971
- 1971 The File Transfer Protocol, which is still used today, allowed ARPANET users to send files to each other.

4 1982: the ARPANET community grows
- By 1982, the network only had about 100 nodes.
- A new bulletin board system called Usenet was invented in 1980 and caught on quickly.
- Usenet was organized by topic, allowing users to swap programming tips, recipes, jokes, opinions about science fiction, and much more.

1984: ARPANET becomes the internet
- reorganized as a decentralized "network of networks."--> internet
- TCP/IP. These standards specified the basic format of data packets transmitted across the internet.
- TCP/IP didn't make much difference from a user perspective
- much faster network growth by lowering the barrier to entry for new networks.
- first new networks to connect to the new internet was CSNET
- By the time the ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990

- supercomputer
- NSFNET
- 1994 become centralized
